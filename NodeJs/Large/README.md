## Folder Structure

Here's a suggested folder structure for a large Node.js Express project in TypeScript:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the project.
  - `controllers/`: Contains the request handlers or controllers.
  - `middlewares/`: Contains custom middleware functions.
  - `models/`: Contains the data models or database schemas.
  - `routes/`: Contains the route definitions.
  - `services/`: Contains the business logic or service layer.
  - `utils/`: Contains utility functions or helper modules.
  - `index.ts`: The entry point of the application.
- `test/`: Contains the test files and test suites.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files.
- `public/`: Contains static files, such as CSS or client-side JavaScript.
- `docs/`: Contains project documentation, such as API documentation or design documents.
- `scripts/`: Contains build scripts or deployment scripts.
- `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies.

## Industry Standards

- Follow the SOLID principles for clean and maintainable code.
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling and testability.
- Implement logging and error handling for better debugging and error reporting.
- Use linting and code formatting tools to enforce code style consistency.
- Implement automated testing, such as unit tests and integration tests.
- Use version control, such as Git, and follow branching and merging best practices.
- Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Consider security best practices, such as input validation and authentication/authorization mechanisms.

## Tips and Tricks

- Use TypeScript's static typing to catch errors early and improve code quality.
- Utilize middleware functions for common tasks, such as authentication or error handling.
- Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information and configuration.
- Implement rate limiting and request throttling to protect against abuse or DoS attacks.
- Monitor and log application metrics for performance optimization and troubleshooting.
- Implement proper error handling and error reporting to provide meaningful feedback to users.

Remember, this is just a template and you can customize it based on your project's specific requirements and preferences.
