## Best Practices and Design Patterns for Large Project Structure

- Use a modular folder structure to organize your codebase.
- Separate concerns by grouping related files together.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for files and folders.
- Use version control to track changes and collaborate with your team.
- Implement a design pattern such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to separate the presentation logic from the business logic.
- Use dependency injection to decouple components and improve testability.
- Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.
- Document your code and provide clear instructions for other developers.
- Continuously refactor and optimize your codebase to improve performance and maintainability.
- Consider using a package manager to manage dependencies and simplify the installation process.

Remember, these are just general guidelines, and you should adapt them to fit your specific project requirements and team preferences.
