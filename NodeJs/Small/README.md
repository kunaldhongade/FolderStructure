## Structure of a Simple Application with Database Routes

In a simple application with database routes, the starting point is usually the `index.js` file. It is recommended to have a basic template and a `.env` file in every project.

While the initial structure of your code may not be critical when starting a project, it becomes important if you want to showcase and impress potential recruiters.

## Why do we need a README file in a small project?

Even in small projects, having a README file for your routes folder can bring several benefits:

1. **Documentation**: It provides a centralized place to document the purpose, structure, and usage of your API routes. This helps developers understand the project quickly and reduces confusion.

2. **Onboarding**: When new developers join the project, they can refer to the README file to get an overview of the routes and how they are organized. This speeds up the onboarding process and ensures consistency in development.

3. **Maintenance**: As the project evolves, it becomes easier to maintain and update the routes when there is clear documentation available. It helps in identifying and resolving issues quickly.
