For an simple application with database routes

index.js will be our starting point

every project should have basic template and .env compulsory

although if you are just starting it does not matter how you structure your code but it really matters if you want to show and impress your recruiter

## Why do we need a README file in a small project?

Even in small projects, having a README file for your routes folder can bring several benefits:

1. **Documentation**: It provides a centralized place to document the purpose, structure, and usage of your API routes. This helps developers understand the project quickly and reduces confusion.

2. **Onboarding**: When new developers join the project, they can refer to the README file to get an overview of the routes and how they are organized. This speeds up the onboarding process and ensures consistency in development.

3. **Maintenance**: As the project evolves, it becomes easier to maintain and update the routes when there is clear documentation available. It helps in identifying and resolving issues quickly.
