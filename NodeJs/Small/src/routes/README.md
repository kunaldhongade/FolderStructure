# Routes Folder

The `routes` folder in your Node.js Express project is where you define and organize your API routes. This README file serves as a guide to understand the purpose of the folder and how to use it effectively.

## Why do we need a routes folder in a small project?

In a small project, having a separate `routes` folder helps in organizing and managing the API routes effectively. Here are a few reasons why it is beneficial:

1. **Modularity**: By separating the routes into individual files, you can easily manage and maintain different API endpoints. It improves code readability and makes it easier to understand the functionality of each route.

2. **Scalability**: As your project grows, the number of API endpoints may increase. Having a dedicated folder for routes allows you to easily add, modify, or remove routes without cluttering the main application file.

3. **Code Organization**: Grouping related routes together based on their functionality helps in keeping the codebase organized. It makes it easier to locate and update specific routes when needed.

4. **Reusability**: With separate route files, you can reuse common functionality across different routes. For example, you can define middleware functions or authentication logic in a separate file and reuse them across multiple routes.

Overall, the routes folder provides a structured approach to handle API routes in a small project, making it easier to maintain, scale, and collaborate on the codebase.

## How to use the routes folder?

1. **Create Route Files**: Start by creating individual route files for each API endpoint. For example, if you have an endpoint for user authentication, you can create a file named `auth.js` or `auth.ts` inside the `routes` folder.

2. **Organize Routes**: Group related routes together based on their functionality. For instance, you can create separate files for user-related routes, product-related routes, etc. This helps in maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

3. **Export Routes**: Each route file should export an Express Router instance that defines the routes for that specific functionality. You can use the `express.Router()` method to create a router instance and define the routes using the router's methods like `get()`, `post()`, etc.

4. **Mount Routes**: In your main `app.js` or `index.js` file, import the route files and mount them on the Express app using the `app.use()` method. This ensures that the routes are accessible and functional.

## Examples of how route files should look like

Here are a few examples of how your route files inside the `routes` folder can be structured:

### Example 1: User Routes (user.js)

### Example 2: Auth Routes (Auth.js)
