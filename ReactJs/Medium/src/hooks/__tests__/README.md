# The `__tests__` Folder in React Hooks

The `__tests__` folder is a convention used in React Hooks to store test files for the hooks. It is typically placed alongside the hook implementation file.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `__tests__` folder is to separate the test files from the actual hook implementation files. This helps in organizing and maintaining the codebase by keeping the tests separate from the production code.

## Advantages

- **Code Organization**: Having a dedicated folder for tests makes it easier to locate and manage test files.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping tests separate from the implementation code promotes better separation of concerns and improves code maintainability.
- **Testability**: By having tests in a separate folder, it becomes easier to write and run tests for the hooks.

## Best Practices

- **Naming Convention**: It is a common practice to name the test files with the same name as the hook file, but with the `.test.js` extension. For example, if the hook file is `useCustomHook.js`, the corresponding test file would be `useCustomHook.test.js`.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage to ensure the reliability and correctness of the hooks.
- **Test Isolation**: Each test file should be independent and not rely on the state or behavior of other tests.
- **Mocking Dependencies**: Use mocking techniques to isolate the hook being tested from its dependencies, such as external APIs or services.

Remember to write meaningful and descriptive test cases to ensure the quality of your hooks.
