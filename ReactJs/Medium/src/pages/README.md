# Pages Folder in React

The `pages` folder in a React project is a common convention used to organize the different pages or views of a web application. Each page typically represents a separate route or URL that the user can navigate to.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `pages` folder is to separate the different pages of the application into individual components. This helps in maintaining a clear and organized codebase, making it easier to understand and modify specific pages without affecting others.

## Advantages

- **Modularity**: Each page is encapsulated within its own component, making it easier to manage and reuse code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The `pages` folder allows for a clear separation between the UI components and the business logic, improving code maintainability.
- **Routing**: The `pages` folder aligns well with routing libraries in React, making it straightforward to define routes and navigate between pages.

## Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Each page component should have a single responsibility and focus on rendering the specific content for that page.
- **Reusable Components**: Identify common UI components that can be reused across multiple pages and extract them into separate reusable components.
- **Routing Configuration**: Use a routing library (e.g., React Router) to define the routes and handle navigation between pages.
- **Code Organization**: Consider grouping related pages into subfolders within the `pages` folder to further organize the codebase.
