This code snippet is located in the hooks folder within the **test** directory of a React project.

The hooks folder in a React project's **test** directory typically contains custom test hooks that are used for testing React components. These hooks are designed to facilitate the testing process by providing reusable logic and utilities.

To write the hooks folder in a React project with best practices, consider the following guidelines:

- Organize the hooks based on their functionality or purpose.
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for the hooks.
- Ensure that each hook has a clear and specific responsibility.
- Write comprehensive unit tests for each hook to ensure their correctness and reliability.

Here are a few examples of how the hooks folder in a React project's **test** directory can be structured:

hooks/
├── useCustomHook1.test.js
├── useCustomHook1.js
├── useCustomHook2.test.js
└── useCustomHook2.js

In this example, the hooks folder contains two custom hooks: useCustomHook1 and useCustomHook2. Each hook has its own JavaScript file and a corresponding test file.

For more information on writing tests for React components and hooks, you can refer to the official React Testing Library documentation: [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

Please note that the specific structure and naming conventions of the hooks folder may vary depending on the project's requirements and conventions.
