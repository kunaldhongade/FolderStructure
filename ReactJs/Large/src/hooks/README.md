This code snippet is located in the 'hooks' folder of a React project.
The 'hooks' folder is typically used to store custom React hooks, which are functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components.

To write hooks in a standard way with best practices, consider the following guidelines:

- Begin the hook name with the word 'use' to indicate that it's a hook.
- Make sure the hook follows the rules of hooks, such as not calling hooks conditionally.
- Document the purpose and usage of the hook using JSDoc-style comments.
- Test the hook thoroughly to ensure its correctness and reliability.

Here's an example of how you can document a custom hook in a README.md file:

## Custom Hook: useFetchData

### Description

This hook is used to fetch data from an API endpoint and handle loading, error, and success states.
